\section{Limitations of the FLOS tools that integrate the container}

\label{limit}

First, it should be noted that functional bitstreams of the SoC have been achieved using this container for the Arty A7 35T and 100T FPGAs.

\vspace{5mm} 

\noindent However, the generation of the bitstream through these FLOS tools have a couple of limitations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Yosys synthesis, in the case of Xilinx, does not support an implementation using DSPs or distributed RAM (LUT RAM).
Just as for Lattice this tool is very mature, for Xilinx this tool is at an early stage.
\vspace{2mm}
\item In case NEORV32 is synthesized with its own \say{app\_image}, without using the bootloader (in the example the bootloader is used), the IMEM implementation is limited (I use 6*1024 bits). Therefore, the size of the compiled programs is restricted.
If a large IMEM is implemented, which in Vivado would be supported, the generated bitstream does not work.
\end{itemize}
